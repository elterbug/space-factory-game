Latest version before i change the style of gameplay

I remembered some constraints I have, and realized that the style of gameplay (build a base and farm stuff for a long time) wouldn't work. I have decided to change the style of gameplay to somthing that resembles something more like diep.io or digdig.io
Since (as of the time of wrighting this), i only have 2 weeks until this needs to be done, I am also just gonna kinda be leaving old features just lying around so  ¯\\__(ツ)_/¯
