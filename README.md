# Space factory thing
A game about making a factory in space. Idk what to name it tho.

The project files are in the folder projects/

# How to run
Using the turbowarp packager (packager.turbowarp.org), upload the server file and pick a project id <br>
Package the project and use **the same project id** to package the client <br>
Run the server then the client, making sure that the windows are both visible (to avoid strange behavior with the server not updating properly)
